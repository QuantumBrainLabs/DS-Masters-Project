## Project README - Business Location Analysis Application

Welcome!

When it comes to starting a business, taking the first step is often the most challenging part. Understanding where to position your business and how much investment is required can be crucial to success. That's where we come in.

### Project Description

We are developing an application that helps determine the best location to position a business. Our application takes various factors into account, including:

- Industry/Niche
- Population Density
- Existing Businesses in the Area
- Price per Square Meter of Construction

### Future Objectives

While we understand that this may seem ambitious, our long-term vision is to expand this project. As a practical approach during the Master's program, we will focus on the restaurant industry within the community of Barcelona, Spain. Additionally, in the Deep Learning Master's program, we plan to extend the project with machine learning techniques and incorporate other features, such as:

- Initial Investment
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) / Net Present Value (NPV)
- Permits and Forms

### Datasets

To achieve our goals, we will be utilizing data from various sources, including:

- datos.gob.es
- thefork.com
- fotocasa.com
- idealista.com
- trivago.com
- barcelona.data.es

### Delivery

Today, we are thrilled to present the Python application. By providing the desired area, industry, and user preferences, the program will geographically locate the most suitable available location based on all the mentioned data.

### Business Need

We recognize the crucial factors that can lead to business failure when starting a venture:

- Poor location projection
- Low foot traffic
- High competition in the area
- Lack of competition in the area
- Age group segmentation
- Lack of knowledge about the permitting process
- Taxation pressure

Our application aims to address these challenges and help entrepreneurs make informed decisions when choosing the best location for their businesses.
